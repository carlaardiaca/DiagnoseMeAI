Lately, I've been experiencing extreme thirst and a frequent need to urinate. Additionally, I've lost some weight without any apparent reason. 

I have noticed a persistent cough that doesn't seem to get better, accompanied by difficulty breathing and wheezing. Recently, I've also had episodes of fever and fatigue. 

I'm experiencing joint pain, especially in my hands and knees, that seems to worsen with cold weather. I've also noticed morning stiffness in the same areas. 

For a few weeks now, I've been feeling a sharp pain in the lower right part of my abdomen. The pain seems to intensify after eating and is sometimes accompanied by nausea.

I've developed a butterfly-shaped rash on my cheeks and the bridge of my nose. Additionally, I've been feeling more tired than usual and experiencing frequent headaches.

I'm having vision problems, such as blurred vision and difficulty seeing at night. I've also noticed that colors don't seem as bright as they used to be. 

I've been feeling heart palpitations and sometimes shortness of breath, even with light activities. I've also had episodes of dizziness without any apparent reason.
